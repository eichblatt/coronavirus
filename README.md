Analysis of Corona Virus Data
The files in this repo use my kdb library to download daily coronavirus data by state in the USA, and plot it from various perspectives.
I did this mostly as a way to build up the kdb library's functionality as I asked questions of the data.

See the daily [report] (https://github.com/eichblatt/coronavirus/reports/report.html)
